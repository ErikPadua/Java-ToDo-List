# ToDo List
The **ToDo List** is a simple task management program that allows you to **create, view, update, and delete tasks** to stay organized.

It follows the **Kanban methodology** for task status management with three stages: **ToDo, Doing, Done**.


## Main File
```
    src/Application
```

## How to Run
#### 1. Compile the program:

```
    javac Application.java
```
#### 2. Run the program:
```
    java Application
```

## How Status Works
When creating a task, its status is **automatically** set to **ToDo**. The status can later be updated to **Doing** or **Done** by editing the task.
